Current Version 1.1

Changes since 1.0

* Moved to sourceforge
* Optimise drawing code (typically ~50% reduction in drawing time)
	This was by compiling the function outside of the drawing loop
	There are additional savings when only plotting 1 or 2 functions
* Safer evaluation of expressions
	The eval statement now runs with a restricted namespace. This prevents
	a user being able to call other functions within the program.
* Using "math." before a function name (eg math.sin(x)) is optional 
* Preserve center when zooming
* Setup.py install script
* Pressing enter in input boxes refreshes plot
* Make division always use floats (unless you use the // operator)
